              the College of Technology Education – Kumasi Campus of the
              University. The Hall derives its name from the fact that it is the
              first Hall to be built after the University gained autonomy in May
              2004. The Autonomy Hall is a mixed hall with one hundred and
              sixty-five (165) rooms and houses nearly 700 residents.
              Construction works on the government-sponsored Autonomy Hall were

              making it the largest Hall to date on the Kumasi Campus. Built
              with student relaxation and recreation in mind, the Hall provides
              services such as a Junior Common Room, a restaurant, internet
              café, super market as well as a computer room. Not only does the
              Hall’s architecture seek to provide respite from the hustle and
              bustle of campus life, it also takes into consideration students’
              desire for a conducive learning environment which is evident in
              the Hall’s three (3) study rooms. Hall management is top-notch and
              committed to providing the best experience that a student of UEW
              could possibly hope for. Contact: Estate Officer, Mr. Osei Akoto
